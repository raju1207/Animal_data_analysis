# Animal Database Analysis
This repository contains a detailed Animal Dataset featuring 205 species, with data on their physical attributes, ecological roles, and geographic distribution. The dataset has been preprocessed using Python's pandas library to ensure consistency, accuracy, and ease of use for data analysis and machine learning applications.

Features
Physical Attributes: Height (cm), Weight (kg), Lifespan (years), and Color.
Behavioral Traits: Diet, Habitat, Social Structure, and Gestation Period.
Conservation Data: Conservation Status, Predators, and Offspring per Birth.
Geographical Distribution: Countries where each species is found.
Performance Metrics: Average and Top Speed (km/h).
Enhancements
Data Cleaning: Missing values, inconsistent formatting (e.g., ranges like 40-65), and typographical errors were corrected.
Standardization: Numeric ranges (e.g., Height (cm)) were formatted for easier parsing and analysis.
Enrichment: Data has been categorized for easy grouping and visualization (e.g., diet types: Herbivore, Carnivore, etc.).
This dataset is provided in a clean, well-structured CSV format and is ideal for:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualizations and dashboards
Ecological research and predictions
Machine learning pipelines for biodiversity studies
Sample code for loading and analyzing the dataset using pandas is provided below:

python code
import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv('Animal Dataset.csv')

# View the first few rows
print(data.head())

# Example: Filter animals found in Africa
african_animals = data[data['Countries Found'].str.contains('Africa')]
print(african_animals)
